Use cases
=========

Once the infrastucture is up and running, different templated use cases and scenrios can be tried and tested on this environment

`View and execute Ansible automation use cases <https://f5-ansible-use-cases.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ that can be run on the F5 Automation Provisioner to test common scenarios. 

**New Use Cases will be added periodically to provide additional senarios**

.. note::

   Once use cases are executed and you are done using the environment make sure to teardown the lab infrastucture using the steps in the next section
